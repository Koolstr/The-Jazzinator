Concept
============
Create an AI jazz composer 

Implementation
============
Project uses recurrent Neural network to train on a collection of polyphonic midi files in order to generate jazz music in midi form. 
A midi utility package is used to produce and parse midi files.

Sources
============
Check out original project from Siraj Raval (https://github.com/llSourcell/AI_Composer)


Notes
============
Project is incomplete. Code pushes far enough to get model created from training and test and validation data sets but fails at the point of generating music.
